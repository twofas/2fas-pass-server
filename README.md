# 2FAS Pass Server
2FAS Pass Server acts as a secure communication bridge between your mobile device and browser extension, facilitating real-time transmission through WebSockets. The server operates with zero-knowledge architecture and cannot decrypt or access any information being transmitted between any devices.
# What is 2FAS Pass?
2FAS Pass is a local-first, next-generation password manager that puts you in full control of your data. Your passwords and sensitive information are stored on your device, and you decide how and where to synchronize them.

2FAS Pass is designed with privacy and user control at its core. You have full control over:
* **Data storage** - by default, everything stays on your device
* **Synchronization options** - securely sync using your own iCloud or Google Drive with end-to-end encryption (E2EE), your NAS (like QNAP or Synology), other devices, or even your custom cloud via WebDAV
* **Item Permissions** - our Security Tiers system lets you decide how each Item behaves: whether it can be shared with the Browser Extension or if it requires confirmation on your mobile device

The seamless integration between mobile app and browser extension ensures you have secure access to your Items and passwords across all your devices while maintaining full control over your data.
# Key Features
* **Privacy-focused** - No data stored on our servers
* **Local-first architecture** - Your data stays on your device
* **Native synchronization** - Native cloud integration (iCloud/Google Drive)
* **Custom synchronization** - WebDAV support for custom synchronization
* **Security Tiers** - Full control over which Items and passwords are shared with auto-fill and browser extension
* **Cross-platform** - Multiple devices synchronizing across platforms, with support for various browsers
